To-Do
=====

Yet another to-do list app. Web-based, in the spirit of tiny tiny rss.

Q: Why? Such things exist
A: There are two things that I want in a to-do app so badly, that I'm willing to try and write my own in order to get them:
  - Tree-based tasks (any task can have arbirarily many child tasks)
  - Ability to move tasks up/down depending on priority

I don't know of anything that'll let me do both of those. GTD-style apps often don't do the first, and bug-tracking systems often don't do the second.

Other features that would be really cool:
 - Search
 - Ability to archive tasks (either push them into the someday/maybe pile, or somehow write them off completely)
 - Random reminders for someday/maybe tasks (like a panel off to one side that always has three random someday/maybe tasks in it)
 - Ability to collapse task trees
   - related: a view where you just see the root task and the leftmost child (next thing to be done for the root task) or maybe the path to the leftmost child.
 - Color tasks by how old they are
 - detect links, the way google tools detect b/123456 and automatically make it point to buganizer bug number 123456. It'd be cool if I could have m/a1231234 and have that automatically link to an email thread, or c/231asdf and have the go to a calendar event.
 - Tags (@people, !places #things)
 - color-coded dates
 - at the end of the day, pop up a window asking you what you've done. This would be used to track stuff you did that never made it onto the list (like, I was doing X, but then I got interrupted and spend the next three hours helping Y with Z. Obviously I didn't make a task "Help Y" just so I could turn around and go do it. This would help with snippets, maybe time accounting in general).
